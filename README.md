# AES Visualizer 🛡️
This project is a web-based visualizer for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm 🔒. It allows users to input plaintext and a key 🔑, and then visualizes the internal workings of the AES algorithm to produce the corresponding ciphertext 📝.

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with this project, you can simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser 🌐. The project is written in JavaScript and does not require any external dependencies or libraries 📦.

## Usage 🤖
To use the AES visualizer, enter your plaintext and key values in the input fields provided. The visualizer will display the intermediate steps of the AES algorithm, including key expansion, substitution, and permutation. The final output will be the corresponding ciphertext.
